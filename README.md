}
```

**Code Signification:**
* **200** Everything is okay. Enven if it is a post request You will not receive a 201 response because remember you want to get an information.  
* **404** The information in the query where not found. This will be very rare so, contact us if it happens
* **500** Internal server error. Normaly this does'nt concern You but check the error because it could be due to your query like bad formating and so on.
* **503** The bot has not been aible to find a response to your query
* **408** Time out. The bot take too much time to find a response for your query or some ressource take too much time to be available.

Enjoy this bot without restraint  üòÅ !!!
